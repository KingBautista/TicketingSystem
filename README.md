# Promoter Management Module

## Overview
The Promoter Management module allows administrators to manage promoters, their schedules, and handle exceptions using a manual override system. This module supports full CRUD operations, advanced date-based scheduling, and manual assignment of promoters for specific days.

## Features
- Create, edit, and delete promoters
- Schedule promoters for specific dates
- Manual override to force a promoter assignment for a particular day
- Bulk actions and soft delete/restore
- Integrated with the admin panel frontend

## Database Structure
- **promoters**: Stores promoter information (name, description, status, etc.)
- **promoter_schedules**: Stores schedule entries for each promoter (promoter_id, date, is_manual, timestamps)

## Manual Override Explained
Manual Override allows an admin to explicitly assign a promoter for a specific date, regardless of the existing schedule. This is useful for last-minute changes, special events, or exceptions.

- When adding a schedule, check the "Manual Override" box to mark it as a manual assignment.
- Only one manual override is allowed per date; adding a new manual override for the same date will replace the previous one.
- Manual overrides take precedence over regular schedules for that date.

## Backend Usage
- **CRUD Endpoints**: `/promoter-management/promoters` (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- **Schedule Endpoint**: `/promoter-management/promoters/schedule` (POST)
- **Manual Override Endpoint**: `/promoter-management/promoters/manual-update` (POST)
- **Bulk/Archived Routes**: For bulk delete, restore, force delete, and archived listing

## Frontend Usage
- **Promoters List**: View all promoters, their status, and scheduled dates (manual overrides are labeled)
- **Promoter Form**: Create/edit promoters, add schedule dates, and set manual overrides
- **Bulk Actions**: Delete, restore, and force delete multiple promoters

## Example Workflow
1. Admin creates a promoter and schedules them for several dates.
2. On a specific day, a different promoter needs to be assigned. Admin uses the form to add a schedule for that date and checks "Manual Override".
3. The system ensures that the manual override is used for that date, regardless of the regular schedule.

## Notes
- Manual overrides are highlighted in the UI for clarity.
- Only one manual override per date is allowed; the latest one replaces any previous override for that date.
